# Data science and music?
Have you ever wondered how the artists of two different music genres might be connected? If so, you've come to the right place. This webpage provides an exploration of the Wikipedia pages of artists from the two genres "West Coast Hip Hop" and "Dance Pop", using links between the pages to create a network connecting all artists. This network contains several communities, which are further explored. The Wikipedia pages provide a large amount of text, allowing for text and sentiment analysis of artists as well as communites. By including lyrics from some of the songs associated with the artists, it is also possible to explore sentiments of lyrics and investigate how these sentiments change over time.
